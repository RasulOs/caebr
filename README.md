# Linear Algebra Library on Java. [WIP]

The library is useful for everyone who wants to see how some Linear Algebra functions are implemented and for people who want to use them in the Data Science field.

## Features

The library supports a variety of functions to be performed on Vectors and Matrices.

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose
* Standardization, normalization (Min-Max normalization, Z-Score standardization)
* Min, max, mean, sum, mode, median, range, variance, standard deviation
* l0, l1, l2, l-Infinity norms
* map, reduce, filter, slice, forEach, sort, reverse, shuffle, distinct, toList, toArray
* Matrix structure manipulation (dropColumn, setColumn, putColumn, popColumn)
* Vector structure manipulation (drop, set, put, pop)

And etc.
