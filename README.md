# Linear Algebra Library on Java. [WIP]

The library is useful for everyone who wants to see how some Linear Algebra functions are implemented and for people who want to use them in the Data Science field.

## Features

The library supports a variety of functions to be performed on Vectors and Matrices.

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinant, transpose, transforming a matrix to an upper triangular, dot product
* Standardization, normalization (Min-Max normalization, Z-Score standardization)
* Min, max, mean, sum, mode, median, range, variance, standard deviation
* l0, l1, l2, l-Infinity norms
* map, reduce, filter, slice, forEach, sort (ascending or descending), sort with row swaps, reverse, shuffle, distinct, toList, toArray
* Matrix structure manipulation (dropColumn, setColumn, putColumn, popColumn, swapRows, addRows, multiplyRows)
* Vector structure manipulation (drop, set, put, pop)
* Check if matrix is: symmetric, diagonal, anti diagonal, square, identity, upper triangular, lower triangular
* Static methods that manipulate with a given matrix or a vector and do not change the inner state of the classes.

And etc.
